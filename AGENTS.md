# Rust (nightly) style

- Global Rust build artifacts (CARGO_BUILD_BUILD_DIR): be patient with cargo lock, other projects inflight.
- No trivial tests. Avoid happy-path, instead test against the cruel outside world.
- Simplify & avoid over-handling. Lean on implicit/concise behavior as the go-to.
- Prefer functional style.
- Use where clause:

```rs
impl<T> Model for MyModel<T>
where
    T: /*...*/
```

## Managed Cargo deps

- Root Cargo.toml is nix-generated to sync dep versions across repos
  - Repo-local manifest intent in Cargo.poly.toml (no crates.io version numbers)
  - Polyrepo-shared crates.io versions in Cargo.catalog.toml
  - Regen Cargo.toml (devenv shell); if it fails on a dep missing from Cargo.catalog.toml, add it there
    - See the generated Cargo.toml for location of the catalog to edit
    - Pin latest ver from checking `cargo info`
